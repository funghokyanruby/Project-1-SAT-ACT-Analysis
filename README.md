# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

### Problem Statement 

Our team has been tracking the statewide participation of SAT between 2017 and 2018. In this report, I will present my findings and recommendations on how to improve the participation rate of SAT.

Though College board is a not-for-profit organisation, it is necessary to identify target states where we can focus resources on given the circumstances that SAT is facing tough competition from the ACT.  

Since ACT and SAT have very close distribution of participation rate in states all over U.S., if the College board doesn't have a clear picture of which few states are their main target markets, and which few are beyong consideration to expand growth, it's hard to make decision on the future operation plan and marketing strategies. 

Hence, it is essential to generate insights from the existing data, and understand the overall situation, so that the College board can identify target states and focus on them in the following to expand the growth.


## Executive Summary

In 2018, 2.22 million (51%) of students took SAT and 1.91 million (49%) took ACT. Though the market share of SAT are ACT is evenly distributed looking at this number, the actual situation shows the other way - most states with high participation rate in one test have low in the other test.

In order to have a planning on the future marketing strategy, operation strategy, there is a need to understand the market better, for instance, if a certain state is taken by ACT test already, if there is a opportunity for SAT to expand growth, and if it is a considerable market size etc. 

Since ACT and SAT are the competitors in this test taking market, it is necessary for SAT to differentiate itself in the market.The main objective of this analysis to identify target states to expand SAT growth, so that the College Board can allocate resources better in the future. 

In this analysis, I will analyze on the ACT and SAT participation rate, the scores of each test in 2017 and 2018, in order to to understand their correleation between each other. 

Based on the past record of participation rate, performance of scores in different sections, we can understand the position of SAT in the test market and specifically, in which few states, SAT have the dominant participation rate. On top of that, the attempt to understand the correlation between participation rate and performance in test will also help the College board to make decision on adjusting the exam format, difficulty level etc. 

When identifying the target states, it's essential to consider external factors for instance the specific requirement in certain states. This restriction needs to be taken into consideration as well. Hence, we could use the help of outside research to combine with the data analysis to come up with final recommendations.

This report aims to provide decision makers in the College board with a clear picture of test market in U.S and adjust their future business plans through identifying target markets.

## Outside Research

From the data analysis and visulisation carried out, the nature of test distribution is clear that in a state, students choose either SAT or ACT and it's basically a all or nothing situation. To further validate this nature, outside research can help us understand why. 

Among the 50 states, Colorado and Illiniois show the drastic changes in participation rate: 

The participation rate of Colorado increased from 11.0 in 2017 to 100.0 in 2018.

The participation rate of Illinois increased from 9.0 in 2017 to 99.0 in 2018.

Having carried out outside research, the sudden increment in SAT participation rate in these 2 states is in fact due to the mandatory requirment of the state to take SAT.


## Mandatory requirement affects SAT participation rate


#### Mandatory requirement affects SAT participation rate

The relationship between SAT and ACT participation rate is totally competent. Most states with participation rates in one test have low participation rate in the other. Bascially, in one state with high SAT participation rate, the ACT partipation rate is very low. 

Since there is mandatory requirement in certain states to take either SAT and ACT, this can explain the distribution of SAT and ACT participaton rate in U.S.

Below are 3 articles that show which few states have listed ACT or SAT as mandatory, and some states that have made both tests optioal for college admission.

##### 2. Which States Require Students to Take the SAT or ACT?
A growing number of states are requiring high school students to take the SAT or ACT, according to Education Week's annual testing survey.

##### 3. Colorado Changed to the SAT in 2017: What You Need to Know - Testive
On April 11th, 2017 all Colorado high school juniors will take the SAT. Why does this matter? In 2016, only 5500 Colorado students took the test. Effective this spring, Colorado and the College Board partnered to administer the SAT as the stateâ€™s accountability exam and every ...

From the charts , we can see there is also a negative correlation between participation rate and totoal score. 

The total SAT score of Illinois dropped from 1115 to 1019.
The total SAT score of Colorado	droppef from 1201 to 1025.
The total SAT score of Miinesota maintained high above 1200, with a low participation rate of 3.0 and 4.0 in 2017 and 2018.

It seems there is a negative correlation between participation rate and totoal score: the higher the participation rate, the lower the total score.


## Conclusions and Recommendations

When identifying the target states, there are 3 conditons to consider:
    1. participation rate 
    2. market size (college enrolment population)
    3. mandatory state requirement on which test to take 
    
States like Colorado, Connecticut, New Hampshire are required to take SAT, and some other like Montana, Montana, Hawaii are required to take ACT, this restriction must be taken into consideration when choosing which state to expand the growth of SAT growth.

After filtering out those states that are unable to take SAT, then we can look into the market size of the states - college enrollment population. A sizable market is more ideal to expand the growth, those below 500,000 would not be considered.

Among the 50 states, some states are taken by ACT, and those in the middle are the potential markets that College Board can consider to grow. If I have to choose one state with a lower participation rate, I would choose Ohio, due to below reasons: 

Ohio has relatively lower participation rate as 12% only. 

Ohio has made ACT and SAT scores optional for admission of college.   

Ohio has about 1.6 million of students - fufill the criteria of being a sizable market. 

Since Ohio fits all the criteria of being an ideal market to expand SAT participation rate growth, it's my top pick.
