# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

### Problem Statement 

Our team has been tracking the statewide participation of SAT between 2017 and 2018. In this report, I will present my findings and recommendations on how to improve the participation rate of SAT. 

Though College board is a not-for-profit organisation, it is necessary to identify target states where we can focus resources on given the circumstances that SAT is facing tough competition from the ACT.  

The below analysis is carried out to identify target states.

## Outside Research
The relationship between SAT and ACT participation rate is totally competent. Most states with participation rates in one test have low participation rate in the other. Bascially, in one state with high SAT participation rate, the ACT partipation rate is very low. 

Since there is mandatory requirement in certain states to take either SAT and ACT, this can somehow explain the distributin of SAT and ACT participaton rate in U.S.

### Which States Require Students to Take the SAT or ACT?
A growing number of states are requiring high school students to take the SAT or ACT, according to Education Week's annual testing survey.

### Colorado Changed to the SAT in 2017: What You Need to Know - Testive
On April 11th, 2017 all Colorado high school juniors will take the SAT. Why does this matter? In 2016, only 5500 Colorado students took the test. Effective this spring, Colorado and the College Board partnered to administer the SAT as the stateâ€™s accountability exam and every ...

## Conclusions and Recommendations

When identifying the target states, there are 3 conditons to consider:
    1. participation rate 
    2. market size (college enrolment population)
    3. mandatory state requirement on which test to take 
    
States like Colorado, Connecticut, New Hampshire are required to take SAT, and some other like Montana, Montana, Hawaii are required to take ACT, this restriction must be taken into consideration when choosing which state to expand the growth of SAT growth.

After filtering out those states that are unable to take SAT, then we can look into the market size of the states - college enrollment population. A sizable market is more ideal to expand the growth, those below 500,000 would not be considered.

Among the 50 states, some states are taken by ACT, and those in the middle are the potential markets that College Board can consider to grow. If I have to choose one state with a lower participation rate, I would choose Ohio, due to below reasons: 

Ohio has relatively lower participation rate as 12% only. 

Ohio students can choose ACT or SAT to take, as there is no requirement in this state.  

Ohio has about 1.6 million of students - fufill the criteria of being a sizable market.
